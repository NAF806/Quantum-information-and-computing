    "Before looking into specific examples and implications of Quantum Cryptography, it is worth giving a general overview of quantum computing. Quantum computing leverages quantum mechanics to tackle problems beyond the reach of classical computers. Richard Feynman first proposed the concept in 1982 [*1*], envisioning the use of quantum systems for computational purposes. While classical and quantum computers share certain foundational elements, such as chips, logic gates, and binary representation, their fundamental difference lies in how they encode and process information. Classical bits represent either a 0 or 1, whereas quantum bits, or qubits, can represent both 0 and 1 simultaneously due to superposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Superposition allows qubits to exist in a state that is a combination of both $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$, providing quantum computers with vastly greater capacity to store and manipulate information. When measured, a qubit collapses to either 0 or 1, but until that moment, it effectively holds both possibilities, allowing quantum computers to perform multiple calculations at once. This property is key to their potential for solving certain problems exponentially faster than classical computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another fundamental principle in quantum computing is entanglement, a phenomenon where two or more qubits become interconnected such that the state of one directly determines the state of the other, regardless of distance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum gates are used to manipulate qubits, like logic gates in classical computing. These gates, such as the Hadamard gate (which induces superposition) and the CNOT gate (which creates entanglement), exploit quantum properties to perform operations on qubits. "

    "Quantum cryptography leverages quantum mechanics to create a communication system that is secure enough to withstand attacks from classical and quantum computers. The primary focus of quantum cryptography is quantum key distribution (QKD), which enables two locations to share a secret key that can be used to encrypt or decrpyt messages. Additionally, quantum computing poses a significant threat to traditional encryption methods, such as Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA), as algorithms like Shor's Algorithm could efficiently break their security — a concept explored later in this project."

The no-cloning theorem ensures that an eavesdropper (Eve) cannot measure the sequence without disturbing the photons, making Eve detectable. This is only true if there is no error in the system, otherwise Eve will be undetectable.

The algorithm begins by selecting a random integer smaller than the number that you are looking to factorise, *N*. The classical computation of the greatest common divisor (GCD) between this random number and *N* checks if the number has already been factored accidentally. The quantum computers main role is to determine the period of a specific function related to the number that needs to be factorised. Based on this result, the algorithm finds the factors or decides whether a new random number needs to be chosen to be tested. \n",

    "The quantum components, specifically quantum phase estimation (QPE) and inverse quantum fourier transforms (iQFT) underpin the entire process. QPE is essential for determining the period of the arithmetic function $ f(x) = a^x mod N $. After the QPE calculates the arithemtic function, the iQFT converts the quantum state into classical information that can be retrieved from the quantum circuit by measurement. These quantum processes enable the algorithm to theoretically calculate the factors of very large numbers. \n",

    "## Limitations \n",
    "\n",
    "Although Shor's algorithm is extremely powerful, RSA encryption has not yet been broken mainly due to the physical restrictions on quantum computers. The largest number to be factorised using Shor's algorithm is 21 using only a 5 qubit quantum computer[5]. Companies such as D-wave have quantum computers with over 5000 qubtis. Despite this fact, reason for the lack of progression in factorising larger is not due to the quantity of qubits in a quantum computer, but actually a matter of the number of stable qubits. Quantum computers are prone to error and noise which makes it difficult to extract meaningful values. \n"

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This project explored quantum cryptography's potential, particularly the Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) through the BB84 protocol, and the implications of quantum computing with Shor’s algorithm. While both represent groundbreaking advancements, they come with notable limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The BB84 protocol offers robust security by leveraging quantum mechanical properties like superposition, entanglement, and the no-cloning theorem. However, its practicality faces significant challenges. Real-world implementation of this protocol is set back by a number of factors such as noise in quantum channels, environmental interference, and technological imperfections in quantum devices. These factors can introduce errors that can mask the intrusion of an eavesdropper. Additionally, the protocol relies on secure classical communication, which may itself become vulnerable without secure encryption.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, while Shor’s algorithm poses a threat to classical encryption, its practical application is constrained by the current state of quantum hardware. Quantum computers today lack the stability and scale required to factorise large numbers efficiently. Issues such as qubit decoherence, error rates, and limited quantum coherence time hinder the algorithm's effectiveness. Currently Shor's algorithm has only been able to factorise numbers up to 21, far below the scale needed to compromise RSA encryption in real-world scenarios.\n"
